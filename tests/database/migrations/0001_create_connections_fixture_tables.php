/**
 * The host-owned tables the suite's connector/connectable fixtures live in.
 *
 * These were two inline `Schema::create()` calls in the old TestCase's `setUp()`. They
 * are a migration now because the base case resets a real engine by dropping every table
 * and re-migrating — a table created outside the migrator would be dropped on the first
 * teardown and never come back, so every test after the first would fail on the pgsql leg.
 *
 * No `down()`: packages migrate forward only, and the reset never calls one.
